Word-guessing game where the user must guess a word letter by letter.

The program selects a random word from a predefined list.


The user guesses one letter at a time.

If the guessed letter is in the word, it is revealed; otherwise, the program indicates the guess is incorrect.

The game continues until the user correctly guesses the entire word or runs out of attempts.

Display a congratulatory message when the word is guessed.
